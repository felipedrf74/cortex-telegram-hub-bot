# Chat Core v2 Foundation

Chat Core v2 is a reliability-oriented orchestration layer for Nexus Hub chat. It keeps domain services authoritative and treats model output as a typed proposal, not as product truth.

## Architecture Rule

The intelligence layer chooses what to propose.
The policy and command layer decides what is allowed.
The domain service decides what is true.
The response layer decides how to explain it.

This first foundation PR is intentionally behavior-neutral. It adds executable contracts and metadata that later PRs can wire into routing, context building, command previews, confirmations, evals, and iOS cards.

## MVP Rollout Shape

- All product domains get deterministic read support first.
- Confirmed write execution is narrow in the first MVP: Tasks, Notifications, and Decision Center only.
- Secretary, Training, Cooking, and Content write-like actions start as preview-only.
- Finance restricted actions are blocked or manual-review only until a dedicated finance policy pass.

## First-Class Contracts

- Capability registry: executable metadata for route methods, support level, risk, owner service, permissions, flags, schemas, cards, undo, verification, and sensitivity.
- Reasoning policies: explicit tiers from no-model deterministic reads through background planning, each with runtime budgets.
- Command envelopes: versioned schemas, authorization snapshot, idempotency key, audit context hash, and typed execution preconditions.
- Provider capabilities: strict structured output, tool calling, prompt caching, streaming, token accounting, reasoning effort, and provider-state opt-out are explicit flags.
- Audit and replay: model-run metadata, redacted/encrypted payload classes, retention classes, and replay bundle shape.
- Workflow states: async, human-review, verification, retry, stale, timeout, undo, and policy rejection states are modeled before any broad side effects are enabled.

## Non-Goals In This PR

- No live route changes.
- No command execution changes.
- No old chat fallback changes.
- No provider calls.
- No database migration.

Future PRs should consume these contracts incrementally instead of bypassing them with domain-local one-offs.
