# CLAUDE.md — Nexus Hub Backend

**You are working directly on the single-source-of-truth backend for Nexus Hub, a multi-domain AI personal assistant.** Do not assume a multi-agent orchestration, queue system, or "role" — those files were removed in Phase 0 (April 2026). There is one codebase, one main branch, one human owner (Felipe), and one deploy path.

---

## Project

**Nexus Hub** — AI-powered personal operating system. TypeScript/Node.js backend (`@nexushub/core`), Python FastAPI content engine, Swift/SwiftUI iOS client, SQLite data, PM2 process manager, Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS.

**Domains**: secretary, triathlon (being split into gym/running/cycle/swim in Phase 1), content creator, finance, cooking.

**Providers**: Gemini primary (2.5-flash / 2.5-flash-lite), Anthropic fallback (Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5), OpenAI as secondary fallback. See `src/config.ts > providerRouting`.

iOS app is a separate repo at `~/Desktop/Nexus Hub IOS/Nexus Hub/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 20+, TypeScript (CommonJS), Grammy, Express, better-sqlite3, pino
- **AI**: `@google/generative-ai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`
- **Content Engine**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, uvicorn
- **iOS**: Swift 5.9, SwiftUI, iOS 17+, `@Observable`, URLSession async/await, no third-party deps
- **Infra**: single Linux VPS, PM2, Cloudflare Tunnel, GitHub Actions CI
- **Observability**: pino JSON logs, SQLite `audit_trail` + `error_log`, Sentry (optional, Phase 0.F), distributed tracing via `reqId`

---

## Git Workflow

- **main** — production. Everything merges here directly via the validated promote pipeline.
- **feature/** or **fix/** — short-lived branches when doing risky work. Most changes can land on main directly.
- **develop** branch is NOT used. The workflow is single-branch + staging validation.

### Commit format
```
type(scope): description
```
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`. Scopes are free-form but usually match service names (`feat(garmin): ...`).

### Before committing
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit     # must pass
npx vitest run       # must pass
```
Pre-commit hook enforces both.

---

## Deploy Pipeline (validated promote)

```bash
# 1. Ship to staging (isolated install on :8201)
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# 2. Let staging soak (5 min minimum)

# 3. Run smoke tests
./scripts/staging-smoke.sh

# 4. Promote to prod (runs smoke test again as gate, then deploys)
./scripts/promote-to-prod.sh
```

Direct `./scripts/deploy.sh` exists for trivial hotfixes but the default is always promote-to-prod.

**Server**: `dominguez@serverdominguez` — local-network only (IPv6 via Cloudflare Tunnel). GitHub Actions cannot reach it; deploys run from Felipe's Mac.

**See**: `DEPLOY.md` (full runbook), `STAGING.md` (staging setup), `scripts/rollback.sh` (tested dry-run + apply path).

## Critical Rules

### Architecture

1. **Token-zero data reads.** Any operation that's a pure lookup (list tasks, get calendar, fetch readiness) MUST go through a REST route under `/api/v1/`, not through the chat pipeline. If you find yourself adding `chatViewModel.sendMessage()` for a data read, stop.
2. **Gemini-first, Anthropic-fallback.** `providerRouting` in `src/config.ts` controls this per-task-type. Don't hardcode `config.anthropic.model` in new code — use `getActiveProvider()` or `completeOneShotWithFallback()`.
3. **Token cache awareness.** `oauth-store.getTokens()` is cached for 10 min. Call `storeTokens()` or `disconnectProvider()` to invalidate. The audit_trail row is written once per cache-refill, not per call.
4. **Garmin auth safety.** `keepAlive()` must NEVER call `attemptReLogin()` — that triggers MFA emails. Full login is gated behind `serializedAuthRecovery` with a 15-min cooldown.

### Testing

- Tests live in `__tests__/` mirroring `src/` structure.
- External APIs are ALWAYS mocked. Tests that hit real network fail CI.
- SQLite tests use `:memory:`.
- Bug fixes include a failing-test-before-fix whenever reasonable.
- `_resetDecryptCacheForTests()` in `beforeEach` if the test uses `oauth-store` — the decrypted-token LRU is module-scoped.

### Forbidden

- ❌ Modifying `.env`, `data/`, `content-engine/.venv/`
- ❌ Adding real API calls in tests
- ❌ Committing secrets (pre-commit hook enforces via `detect-secrets`)
- ❌ Hardcoding absolute paths (`os.homedir()` or `config.*` instead)
- ❌ Direct `anthropic.messages.create` — route through `trackedCreate()` for cost logging
- ❌ `--amend` or `--no-verify` on commits without explicit user approval
- ❌ Re-adding the multi-agent orchestration scaffolding that was removed in Phase 0

## Active Phase (April 2026)

**Phase 0 — Plumbing + Salvage**: audit_trail bomb fix ✅, worktree cherry-picks (Sentry ✅, dep enforcement ✅), Gemini routing verified ✅, Garmin keepalive verified ✅, orchestration cleanup ✅.

**Phase 1 — Skill Architecture Revamp** (next): triathlon → 4 sub-skills (gym, running, cycle, swim) + shared coach intelligence, data-driven skill catalog, entitlements (`access_level`: free/pro/admin), cross-skill signal wiring via intelligence-bus.

**Phase 2+**: iOS onboarding rewrite, Skills tab replacing Training tab, Notes/Reminders iOS UI, OAuth connect flows, content creator iOS section with Google Drive integration.

See `DEPLOY.md` and the top of this file for operational context. For architecture details on the OAuth bridge, distributed tracing, cost dashboard, staging environment, and validated promote pipeline, see their respective commit messages in `git log`.
