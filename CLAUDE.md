# CLAUDE.md — Nexus Hub Backend

## Agent Bootloader - Read First

This file is a repo-local bootloader. Before creating or updating markdown,
read:

0. Start from the official workspace:
   `/Users/felipedominguez/Desktop/Nexus Hub`
1. `/Users/felipedominguez/Desktop/Nexus Hub/docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
2. `/Users/felipedominguez/Desktop/Nexus Hub/docs/agent/OPERATING_CONTEXT.md`
3. `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
4. `docs/release/current-release-index.md`
5. `docs/qa/QA_BACKEND_REPORT.md`

Do not create a new scattered final report when a current/canonical doc already
exists. Update the current doc and link any one-off evidence from the current
index. Historical reports are evidence, not active truth, unless the current
release index links them. Run `npm run docs:audit` before creating release docs
or copying verdicts, commit hashes, or test counts.

**You are working directly on the single-source-of-truth backend for Nexus Hub, a multi-domain AI personal assistant.** Do not assume a multi-agent orchestration, queue system, or "role" — those files were removed in Phase 0 (April 2026). There is one codebase, one main branch, one human owner (Felipe), and one deploy path.

## Project

**Nexus Hub** — AI-powered personal operating system. TypeScript/Node.js backend (`@nexushub/core`), Python FastAPI content engine, Swift/SwiftUI iOS client, SQLite data, PM2 process manager, Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS.

**Domains**: secretary, triathlon (being split into gym/running/cycle/swim in Phase 1), content creator, finance, cooking.

**Providers**: Gemini primary (2.5-flash / 2.5-flash-lite), Anthropic fallback (Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5), OpenAI as secondary fallback. See `src/config.ts > providerRouting`.

## Current Production Truth - 2026-05-07

- Production backend is live at `4.14.134` on `main`.
- Current production deploy commit is
  `7edf9eb389bb0808893ef2fd038b7e706f567a1e`.
- The 2026-05 tech-debt sweep is source-closed and deployed. The sweep
  addressed the original P0/P1 backend source findings, closed the major P2
  engineering-safety cluster, and leaves only operator-gated carryovers in
  `docs/release/OPEN_ITEMS.md`.
- Production promote completed after staging passed the 17/17 smoke gate.
  Production `/health` returned `healthy`; authenticated local
  `/api/snapshot` returned version `4.14.134`. The snapshot endpoint does
  not currently expose a commit field, so deploy commit truth is taken from git
  and the deploy script output.
- Current deployed branch: `main`.
- Historical beta recovery branch: `beta/single-agent-rc`.
- Sweep closeout dossier:
  `docs/archive/2026-05/tech-debt-validation/sweep-closeout-dossier.md`.

Source-side guarantees after the sweep:

- State isolation: high-risk state modules enforce positive, safe integer user
  identifiers at state-layer entry points. The six-module isolation pack and
  the 23-case P0 chat identity suite are canonical regression contracts.
- JWT rotation: iOS API JWT signing supports `kid`-based key rotation with
  overlap verification and `docs/engineering/jwt-rotation-runbook.md`.
- PM2 recovery: supervisor health and restart-count signals are observable via
  `src/services/pm2-health.ts` and `/health/detailed`.
- Gemini SDK migration: production Gemini code uses `@google/genai`; the
  legacy `@google/generative-ai` runtime dependency was removed.
- Mock hygiene: strict `vi.mock` completeness lint is enforceable at the 827
  partial-mock ceiling.
- Docs hygiene: docs:audit is held at the 480 issue ceiling established by the
  closeout pass.

Verification floor after the source sweep:

- `npm run verify`: 467 test files / 6,973 tests.
- `content-engine/.venv313/bin/python -m pytest tests/`: 135 tests.
- `npx vitest run __tests__/security/p0-chat-identity-isolation.test.ts`:
  23/23 passing.
- `bash scripts/cannot-skip-gate-dashboard.sh --json --no-evidence`: 23/23
  passing.
- `node scripts/vi-mock-completeness-lint.mjs --strict`: 827/827 passing.
- `npm run docs:audit`: 480 issues / 427 audited markdown files at the final
  pre-deploy source gate.

Remaining beta/operator gates:

- Signed TestFlight and two-account walkthrough.
- APNs token and delivery validation.
- Real Gmail/Outlook/Health provider-state checks.
- Non-prod Google/Outlook OAuth credentials provisioning.
- Garmin MFA/live-session validation.
- Content portal smoke window.
- iOS fastlane setup, if Felipe chooses to pursue it.
- Self-hosted runner provisioning only if SSH-only promote workflows require it.

## Codex + Claude Operating Protocol

- Treat this file and `docs/agents/claude/handoff.md` as the backend
  cross-agent starting point. In the iOS workspace, read `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/00-CURRENT-PRODUCT-TRUTH.md`, and
  `specs/27-CLAUDE-CODE-HANDOVER.md`.
- Codex has been working by verifying QA reports with code/runtime evidence,
  implementing scoped fixes, running focused and broad tests, deploying through
  staging smoke before production, and updating docs before handoff. Claude
  should follow the same loop.
- Backend production changes should follow: focused tests/typecheck,
  staging deploy, staging smoke, production promote, production health, docs
  update. Do not skip the staging smoke gate.
- Token-zero remains law for iOS: ordinary operational flows use REST routes,
  not fake chat commands or prompt-driven lookups.
- Avoid single-tenant runtime assumptions in prompts, caches, background jobs,
  provider fallbacks, and user-facing copy. Hardcoded founder identity belongs
  only in docs, provenance notes, or explicit owner-only fixtures.
- If credentials, APNs, TestFlight, OAuth, HealthKit, Gmail/Outlook, or provider
  access are required, document the exact env/command and mark the item as
  manual verification required.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 20+, TypeScript (CommonJS), Grammy, Express, better-sqlite3, pino
- **AI**: `@google/generative-ai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`
- **Content Engine**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, uvicorn
- **iOS**: Swift 5.9, SwiftUI, iOS 17+, `@Observable`, URLSession async/await, no third-party deps
- **Infra**: single Linux VPS, PM2, Cloudflare Tunnel, GitHub Actions CI
- **Observability**: pino JSON logs, SQLite `audit_trail` + `error_log`, Sentry (optional, Phase 0.F), distributed tracing via `reqId`

---

## Git Workflow

- **main** — production. Everything merges here directly via the validated promote pipeline.
- **feature/** or **fix/** — short-lived branches when doing risky work. Most changes can land on main directly.
- **develop** branch is NOT used. The workflow is single-branch + staging validation.

### Commit format
```
type(scope): description
```
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`. Scopes are free-form but usually match service names (`feat(garmin): ...`).

### Before committing
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit     # must pass
npx vitest run       # must pass
```
Pre-commit hook enforces both.

---

## Deploy Pipeline (validated promote)

```bash
# 1. Ship to staging (isolated install on :8201)
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# 2. Let staging soak (5 min minimum)

# 3. Run smoke tests
./scripts/staging-smoke.sh

# 4. Promote to prod (runs smoke test again as gate, then deploys)
./scripts/promote-to-prod.sh
```

Direct `./scripts/deploy.sh` exists for trivial hotfixes but the default is always promote-to-prod.

**Server**: `dominguez@serverdominguez` — local-network only (IPv6 via Cloudflare Tunnel). GitHub Actions cannot reach it; deploys run from Felipe's Mac.

**See**: `DEPLOY.md` (full runbook), `STAGING.md` (staging setup), `scripts/rollback.sh` (tested dry-run + apply path).

## Critical Rules

### Architecture

1. **Token-zero data reads.** Any operation that's a pure lookup (list tasks, get calendar, fetch readiness) MUST go through a REST route under `/api/v1/`, not through the chat pipeline. If you find yourself adding `chatViewModel.sendMessage()` for a data read, stop.
2. **Gemini-first, Anthropic-fallback.** `providerRouting` in `src/config.ts` controls this per-task-type. Don't hardcode `config.anthropic.model` in new code — use `getActiveProvider()` or `completeOneShotWithFallback()`.
3. **Token cache awareness.** `oauth-store.getTokens()` is cached for 10 min. Call `storeTokens()` or `disconnectProvider()` to invalidate. The audit_trail row is written once per cache-refill, not per call.
4. **Garmin auth safety.** `keepAlive()` must NEVER call `attemptReLogin()` — that triggers MFA emails. Full login is gated behind `serializedAuthRecovery` with a 15-min cooldown.

### Testing

- Tests live in `__tests__/` mirroring `src/` structure.
- External APIs are ALWAYS mocked. Tests that hit real network fail CI.
- SQLite tests use `:memory:`.
- Bug fixes include a failing-test-before-fix whenever reasonable.
- `_resetDecryptCacheForTests()` in `beforeEach` if the test uses `oauth-store` — the decrypted-token LRU is module-scoped.

### Forbidden

- ❌ Modifying `.env`, `data/`, `content-engine/.venv/`
- ❌ Adding real API calls in tests
- ❌ Committing secrets (pre-commit hook enforces via `detect-secrets`)
- ❌ Hardcoding absolute paths (`os.homedir()` or `config.*` instead)
- ❌ Direct `anthropic.messages.create` — route through `trackedCreate()` for cost logging
- ❌ `--amend` or `--no-verify` on commits without explicit user approval
- ❌ Re-adding the multi-agent orchestration scaffolding that was removed in Phase 0

## Active Phase (April 2026)

**Beta release hardening is the active production context.** The backend beta
hardening work has been deployed to production as `4.14.74` from `main`; do not treat the
older Phase 0/Phase 1 notes as the current release state.

Current backend follow-ups:

- keep tenant/founder/business-rule docs aligned with the beta tracker;
- validate the latest Content scheduling, high-quality AI script generation, Training readiness,
  Secretary recurrence, and Health fixes in a signed TestFlight device build;
- device-validate the Training coach engine hardening pass;
- run another production-safe alert drill only if the final receiver differs
  from the staging receiver;
- keep deploy scripts worktree-safe;
- avoid broad architecture rewrites until the signed TestFlight/device gates
  are complete.

Current iOS-dependent release gates:

- signed TestFlight smoke;
- fresh Apple/Google/email auth and interrupted onboarding;
- APNs token upload and safe delivery;
- true two-account switching between Felipe and Jaqueline test accounts;
- real Gmail/Outlook/Health provider-state validation.

See `DEPLOY.md`, `STAGING.md`, `docs/OBSERVABILITY-ONCALL.md`, and
`docs/beta/single-agent-status.md` for operational context.
